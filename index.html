<p>"My family has had cookies made by Kayla for several parties in the past, so for my sister&rsquo;s Bridal Shower she was the obvious choice! Kayla&rsquo;s cookies are consistently delicious and also look fabulous, down to literally the smallest of details. Kayla is also extremely reliable and I know I can count on her to make any occasion extra special and sweet!"</p>

<p>"Kayla made cookies for my bridal shower last spring, and I don&rsquo;t know how she does it! The cookies look so much like beautiful decorations, but are so delicious at the same time! She designed half of these cookies as a calendar with a heart around the day of the wedding - I couldn&rsquo;t believe how perfect it was! I still have one of them saved so I&rsquo;ll never forget!"</p>
